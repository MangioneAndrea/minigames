# Minigames

what to say... I wanted to write some rust, so this is the result, a webapp using wasm with some inbound minigames.

:warning: **This is a cursed package. All the games will make you tilt at some point**


## How to..

Of course you need rust. After you installed that, you can use trunk to run the app. Just that line does the job

```shell
cargo build
trunk serve
```
